Couchy

Couchy is a simple frontend on top of CouchDB with the aim of allowing a designer to specify the schema of a CouchDB document using plain old html.

Neat concept, huh?!

So it works like this:

Create a html file, let's say a mockup of a final design. Call it template.html.

Run couchy (it's a little Sinatra page):

ruby couchy.rb
(fires up on port 4567, whoop!)

Check out http://localhost:4567

You'll see Pages and Templates
